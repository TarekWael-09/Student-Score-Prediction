🎓 Student Score Prediction
📌 Overview

This project focuses on predicting student exam scores based on study-related factors.
The aim is to analyze how input features (like study hours, attendance, etc.) affect performance and use regression techniques to make accurate predictions.

⚙️ Project Workflow

Data Preprocessing

Cleaned dataset (handled missing values & duplicates)

Prepared features for training

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Data visualization (distributions, correlations)

Identified trends between study hours and exam scores

Modeling

Implemented Linear Regression

Implemented Polynomial Regression to capture non-linear relationships

Compared model performance

Evaluation

Used metrics such as R² Score, Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

Polynomial Regression showed better fit for non-linear patterns

🛠️ Tech Stack

Python 🐍

Pandas, NumPy → Data processing

Matplotlib, Seaborn → Visualization

Scikit-learn → Regression models

📊 Results

Linear Regression provides a good baseline model.

Polynomial Regression captures non-linear trends and improves prediction accuracy.
